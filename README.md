# ClubHop---Backend-Implementation
In terms of Node.JS and APIs, I was able to successfully implement the backend portion to a Club React Native application in order to help students sign up for clubs of their interest. Due to the time constraint, I had to get this working within 2 weeks. The users are able to successfully login to the application, follow club events, unfollow club events, view club events on the calendar, change their account password, upload their profile image, and add an event to the database. I also provided the connection implementation as shown with the Frontend Club Connect code posted on my github.

Progress as of 11/6/2020:
